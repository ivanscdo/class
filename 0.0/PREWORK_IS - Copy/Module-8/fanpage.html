<h2> Bio </h2>
<p>Omar Rodríguez-López is an American multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, producer, writer, actor and film director. He is most widely known as the band leader of the now defunct prog band The Mars Volta, but has also been involved with the bands At the Drive-In, De Facto, Bosnian Rainbows, and Antemasque. He has also lead an impressive solo career with a discography currently spanning 51 solo albums.

<p>
Omar Rodríguez-López was born in Bayamon, Puerto Rico in 1975, but grew up in El Paso, Texas. He began playing the bass at age 12, but switched to guitar at 15 because he "needed more strings." In 1996, a long time friend, Cedirc Bixler-Zavala, invited him to join the post-hardcore band At the Drive-In where he remained until 2001. Following this band's hiatus, both he and Bixler-Zavala refocused their efforts on a dub outfit called De Facto before going on to form The Mars Volta. It was during this time he released his first solo album, A Manual Dexterity: Soundtrack Volume One. The Mars Volta remained active until 2013 when they announced they had broken up following a series of tweets by frontman Cedirc Bixler-Zavala. In 2012, At the Drive-In reunited and has since been touring. Omar Rodriguez-Lopez also went on to form the group Bosnian Rainbows in 2012 and later Antemasque in 2014. However, both have been put on hold due to touring commitments of At the Drive-In.

What are the rules of the game?

cat must capture cheesy puffs
capture is defined is cat touching the cheesy puffs
cat can move with arrow keys
cheesy puffs switch location after each successful capture
capture 10 cheesy puffs to win the game



How does that translate into code?

generate random location for cat and cheesy puffs upon start of game

if location of cat and cheesy puffs are the same, score goes up by one, generate new random locations for both cath and cheesy puffs

if score equals 10, game ends, present game over screen



Will we need to use loops? if/else statements?

Yes, loops will be used to control if the game continues or ends. If/else statements will be used to keep track of the score. 



What variables will we need?

cat, cheesy puffs, score, location of cat, location of cheesy puffs


Under what circumstances will our variables change?

The score will change with each successful capture of cheesy puffs by the cat, as well as the location of the cat and cheesy puffs.

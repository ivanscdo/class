// // // PRESENTATION
// swap two var without using third, why manhole cover round?

//  interview process, allday 45mins, not fundamental, algorythmic questions, script looks for degree or education/certification, screen for experience

// swap 2 var without introducin 3rd
var a = 1;
console.log(a);
var b = 2;
console.log(b);
// a.push(b);
a = b;
console.log(a);
b = a;
console.log(b);

// solution
a = a + b;
b = a - b;
a = a - b;

// microsoft
// thought process, are they approaching probem the same way
// see how they think about, how they approach, how they start
// 50% see how it's solved, solution

// sorti list of numbers? slow and quick ways to do that
// brute force compare every two numbers, then ask for optimization
// have notes on previous int, "struggled on x, see how they do", most people don't get in first time, don't be discouraged by rejection

// exponentiation problem
// given two int, raise one to power of the other
// no native solution, can you use loops etc

//orientation, two weeks, same first week intro to comp/culture, etc, second week eng go over infrastructure, how to code at google, use repo sys not public, p4(???), seond week all technical, lif eof query, when user types query what happens, life of data center, planning for power/resources, 6months of not being production, learning, given task, learn 6 things to carry how task, every part of task specific to google, MEAN stack/express/mongo db/react/node bach not used, shared code base with shared infrastruce, doesn't matter that you're in your own world, 100,000 other people pretty much public
// day to day
// open/flexible, job in austin? made it! timezone difference with CA, don't have to be ther at sm

// testingi culter, nit tests!!
// "i think i'm done, will run test", rum through it, write unit tests, bring own markers!
// top attribute
// counter ex:var test, jumped straight to perfect solution, get something when ask and they struggle, work through it, hit roadblock, plow througoh, then ask for help, bad sign if not asking for help, dont waste time/money, ask!

// blog post steve eaki, great list of all things to study!!
// most of solution will be hashing, hash maps!! a lot of algorytms, intense algorthm, code complex, algorythm desin manual, not many unique problems, python is best for interviews, fast not a lot of syntax, interviewer specifies langs comfortable with, matched with interviewees

// phone screen, 1/200 get thru
// don't start with solution that you know to be blatently wrong, "always be talking, thinking outloud, follow along with thought process"

// general software eng position, microsft: se in test, google: se testing and infrastructure
// not a lot of specialized positions, specify location, 
// all the same posting, software eng, like hourglass

// problem
// banned questions that are too widely known
// n children line, each child have score, lined up in random order, want to reward for scores, give away few candies as possile, wantn to give more to another within neighbor

// edge cases!! what can break?
// fork github repos, work

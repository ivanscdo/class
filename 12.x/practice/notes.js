// USE - switches to that db for rest of script, good practice to make sure always using right db,
 
//VARCHAR(30) 30 character string

//NOT NULL - required field, won't be able to add record that does not have those, 

//NULL is default

//BOOLEAN - 0 false, 1 true

//INTEGER(10) - 10 up to 10 digit int

//end statements with ;

//DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS - ex: can use to refresh database, will drop(delete) everything, can save as init.sql file

//table names and column names lowercase with underscores


//id column serves as main id, used to target specific records, 

//SIGNED VS UNSIGED, signed cannot be negative, unsigned can be negative, signed more room to store values, 

//AUTO_INCREMENT, allows sql to create id, in case multiple sends, not having to manually keep track of id#'s

//PRIMARY KEY of table to id, indexes within db, increases performance of db, can only contain unique values

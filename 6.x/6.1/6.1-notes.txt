mashape.com


omdbapi.com

you get back, what they want you to get back

not turnkey, ned to read documentation to get idea of how to use

t parameter allows for 

ðŸ˜¯
http:// - protocol, hyper text transfer protocol
www.omdbapi.com/ - site, host name, site we want to make request to
?t=Forrest+Grump&y=&plot=short&apikey=trilogy - query string

? - begin search
    t=Forrest+Grump - search this title
& - another parameter
    y= - not required, but can be empty, just ex no reason to include
&
    plot=short
&
    apikey=trilogy - name they chose to parameter

does not need specific order


"hi i'm api key x, give me this movie with short plot"
send response as JSON 

xml - like html, but data transfer instead of document type, like html with tags, 

synchronous code execution  - one thing at a time, this line, this line, then this line
asynchronous  - starts doing thing, then later comes back to it when it needs to
AJAX is asynchronous

$.get(url).then(function)

.get returns promise - type that reflects that it will be fulfilled or rejected

get this, then do this

.get & .post

.data gets all the information related to the movie, use dot notation to access individual values

firebase
    real time data base, as soon as somebody makes an update to some piece of data, get alert so you can update your page

1st - get setup!
    npm install - g firebase-tools
    npm node package manager, get into node using everyday, detch a package for js, to include wihtin out ap
    -g installs something globally, rather than current project, tool isntalled on coputer, grabs firebase pack, adds on application, run on anywhere, actual .exe
    firebase-tools

    next:
    console.firebase.google.com
        add project
            give it a name, creates project id, set country/region to us, google matches to closes data center
        continue, in firebase starter docs

        add firebase to web app, copy code where can access quickly, setup code
        database
            get started, real time database
            gives some stuff: representation of data
            rules: open to everyone, don't worry abot setting up auth first
            read and write prop to true
            production app, read7write true wold not be acceptable


firebase script!!!
    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/4.11.0/firebase.js"></script>
    <script>
    // Initialize Firebase
    var config = {
        apiKey: "AIzaSyCTMwWdU5CqMwMaxsQlVAVwsM54mzVFvjw",
        authDomain: "introfirebase7-2.firebaseapp.com",
        databaseURL: "https://introfirebase7-2.firebaseio.com",
        projectId: "introfirebase7-2",
        storageBucket: "",
        messagingSenderId: "63364815717"
    };
    firebase.initializeApp(config);
    </script>

creating a firebase project
    find somewhere to work within, directory
    create dir
    first: firebase login (use same email as project!)
    associated terminal user to gmail account, auth taken care of

    next: in dir, run firebase init
        open interactive term
        database & hosting
        ask which project, select proj name
        what file used for database rules? enter
        public dir? enter
        config as single page app? n, enter

files from firebase dir
    hosting public, points to public, start service, to use files from public to run the server
    firebase has built in server
    public saying use public

run server 
    go to firebase server
    run: firebase serve, gives name of url
    go to: localhost:5000, 
    cannot have more than one at the same time
    spin up small server
    delete: 404.html
    empty: index.html
    by default read from index.html, if other pages /whatever.html to access those pages
    given files: dump to public dir
    close/stop
        ctrl-c

deploy to live site
    firebase deploy


<1:07:00>
firebase.js handles initial auth, then specific scripts, in this case firebase-database, next include jQuery, next


1:39:20

all functions written the same way for initialization or updating, work anytime page reloads, forces to write something same effect when data changes


add different data type
    last one, every time add item, overwrote item
    don't wnat to do that every simgle time

    .off("submit")


    data in multiples, use / at end, saying "hey this is a folder that collects multiple objects"
    can pass into firebase anything that is json


CRUD
    create  - create data
        .set()
    read  - read data from database, listen for data
        .on()
    update - update wthout changing entire record
        .update()
    delete - .remove()

index.html
bunch of divs
unique key for that user

32 items deep is max

section data in different refs at top lovel
    user data, blog post data
    seperate refs out into logical groups

from: introFirebase7-2.js
    // ref is either a single value, or holder, holds place, when reference later, use ref to get it, kinda like id, key and object, think of ref as key that will get values out of later
    // setting that key equivalent to 

    // firebase giant JSON, that can be used as database

storing data to retrieve for later use

ex todo list, add items,removed when refreshed, not stored, just changed on page

two types: client side, server side

client side
    stored in browser
    problem: all visible!
    can only store data for one user,

    only store stuff that pertains to current user

    if online can still access data, 

    not many instances where apps used offline

    important piece of info can be stored client side
    
    good for: duplicate data (nothing on client that not stored in server), anything needed offline; ex: on forum, collapse threads, not critical, not negatively impact experience

    incremental ui improvements 

server side
    info is out of reach, stored in one place, everybody's data stored in one place
    all application data


local storage, session storage
local will persist over browser restart
session just for one use

other two types
web sql & indexed DB, more full featured web storage (only supported in chrome!)


when write data to DOM does not persist
how to write to local storage

how to save data past page refresh

can only take primitive values, number/string, not objects etc
workaround!
input with json.stringify()
take out with json.parse()

make sure it exists before you start using it with if (object) {};

cookies
how to store
when you get cookies, you get every bit of data stored with that cookies

set up with options at beginning

document.cookie


read cookie function (google!)

use js cookie instead! which is a library
